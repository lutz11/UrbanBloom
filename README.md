# UrbanBloom

UrbanBloomâ€™s goal is to effectively rank an area based on several factors. 
The ranking system could then be used to inform the consumer 
of the potential growth of an urban area.

UrbanBlooms target audience are immigrants, potential entrepreneurs, 
or anyone else attempting to move somewhere with high urban growth potential.
This is to give them the best potential opportunity to settle in a location 
that could potentially lead to a successful and 
thriving urban hub of trade and commerce.

This project's dependencies are maintained through Poetry; A 3rd party software that acts similarily to Composer 
to ensure the necessary dependencies are available.

Ensure you have Poetry installed on your system and have installed the dependencies by running:
```bash
poetry install
```

To run our examples you may visit the directory and run the following commands:
```bash
poetry run python ./example/<example>.py
```

## Jupyter Notebook
We have provided a Jupyter Notebook to help you explore the UrbanBloom Potential Index data and visualizations. 
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have run the poetry install command first to ensure all dependencies are installed.
Then you can start a Jupyter Notebook by running:
```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

Once you have the notebook running, you can open the [urbanbloom_exploring_and_visualization.ipynb](urbanbloom_exploring_and_visualization.ipynb) file to explore the data and visualizations of our UrbanBloom Potential Index.

## Running The CLI
To run the CLI, you can use the following supported command:
```bash
poetry run urbanbloom --help
```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

Once you have the notebook running, you can open the [urbanbloom_exploring_and_visualization.ipynb](urbanbloom_exploring_and_visualization.ipynb) file to explore the data and visualizations of our UrbanBloom Potential Index.

## Running The CLI
To run the CLI, you can use the following supported command:
