# UrbanBloom

UrbanBloomâ€™s goal is to effectively rank an area based on several factors. 
The ranking system could then be used to inform the consumer 
of the potential growth of an urban area.

UrbanBlooms target audience are immigrants, potential entrepreneurs, 
or anyone else attempting to move somewhere with high urban growth potential.
This is to give them the best potential opportunity to settle in a location 
that could potentially lead to a successful and 
thriving urban hub of trade and commerce.

This project's dependencies are maintained through Poetry; A 3rd party software that acts similarily to Composer 
to ensure the necessary dependencies are available.

To run our examples you may visit the directory and run the following commands:
